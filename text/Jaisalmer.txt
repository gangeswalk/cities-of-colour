Jaisalmer
The Yellow City


Standing along a ridge of yellow sandstone, and crowned by the majestic Jaisalmer Fort, Jaisalmer rightly owns the colour yellow. The Fort and many of the houses and temples of the town below are built of finely sculptured yellow sandstone. Lying along the edge of the Thar Desert, Jaisalmer makes the visitor feel like they have stepped a thousand years back in time.
