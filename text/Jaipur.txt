Jaipur
The Pink City


Pink is the colour of the local stone used in many buildings constructed in Jaipur, Rajasthan. Pink is also the colour of hospitality and so the city paints and maintains this colour in many of its buildings to embrace all who come.  But not just the pink, it is the architecture, traditions, art, jewellery, textiles and people of the city that captivate the visitor.
