Jodhpur
The Blue City


Many of the houses in a certain section of the city of Jodhpur, Rajasthan are painted blue. The city is thus associated with the colour blue. In contrast on the streets you will see the long colourful skirts of the Rajasthani women, the bright reds and yellows of mens' turbans, and the multi-coloured dyes and textiles available in the markets.
