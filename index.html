            <h2>The Pink City</h2>
            <p>Pink is the colour of the local stone used in many buildings constructed in Jaipur, Rajasthan. Pink is also the colour of hospitality and so the city paints and maintains this colour in many of its buildings to embrace all who come.  But not just the pink, it is the architecture, traditions, art, jewellery, textiles and people of the city that captivate the visitor.

            <h2>The Blue City</h2>
            <p>Many of the houses in a certain section of the city of Jodhpur, Rajasthan are painted blue. The city is thus associated with the colour blue. In contrast on the streets you will see the long colourful skirts of the Rajasthani women, the bright reds and yellows of mens' turbans, and the multi-coloured dyes and textiles available in the markets.

            <h2>The White City</h2>
            <p>Nestled among the hills of the Aravalli Range in Rajasthan, Udaipur is known for its picturesque lakes, the white colour of its buildings, and the amazing City Palace, constructed with dazzling white marble and gracing the banks of Pichola Lake. Udaipur is also known for its silk carpets, paintings, marble crafts and artistry in silver and terracotta.

            <h2>The Yellow City</h2>
            <p>Standing along a ridge of yellow sandstone, and crowned by the majestic Jaisalmer Fort, Jaisalmer rightly owns the colour yellow. The Fort and many of the houses and temples of the town below are built of finely sculptured yellow sandstone. Lying along the edge of the Thar Desert, Jaisalmer makes the visitor feel like they have stepped a thousand years back in time.
